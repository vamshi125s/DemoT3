Looping statements:

- to execute the block of code repeatedly till the condition is true.

- for loop - used when we know the no. of iterations.

for(initialization;condition;updation){
    //statements
}

- while - will be used when we dont know the iteration count

while(condition){
    //statements
}

- do while - will be used when we dont know the iteration count

do(){
    //statements
}
while(condition)


- entry-controlled loops - for, while - minimum iteration count is 0
- exit- controlled loop - do while - minimum iteration count is 1
